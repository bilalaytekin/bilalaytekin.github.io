I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland. I did my undergrad at Bogazici University, studying Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am interested in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and formalization.

On this website are my CV, our recent paper "An Alexandrov Topology for Maximal Cohen-Macaulay Modules", and some of the lecture notes I took.

I'm into cycling (recently upgraded to a Diamondback Arden 3, find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/119966249)!), cooking, and chess (on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/hungouttodry)).

You can contact me at ``baytekin (at) umd (dot) edu``.
