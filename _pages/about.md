I have completed my undergrad at Bogazici University, studying Computer Engineering and Mathematics; and I am soon to be a graduate student at the University of Maryland. I am interested in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and formalization.

On this website are my CV and our recent paper along with some of the lecture notes I took in classes.
