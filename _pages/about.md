I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland. I did my undergrad at Bogazici University, studying Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am interested in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and formalization.

On this website are my CV, our recent paper "An Alexandrov Topology for Maximal Cohen-Macaulay Modules", and some of the lecture notes I took.

I'm into cycling, [chess](https://lichess.org/@/hungouttodry), and [movies.](https://letterboxd.com/bilalaytekin/)

You can contact me at ``baytekin (circled 'a') umd (point) edu`` or via one of my profiles above.
