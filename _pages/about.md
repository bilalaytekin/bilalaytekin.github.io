Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at the [University of Maryland.](https://www-math.umd.edu/) I was an undergradate at [Bogazici University.](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index)

I am interested in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and formalization.

On this website are my CV, our paper "An Alexandrov Topology for Maximal Cohen-Macaulay Modules", some of the lecture notes I took, and my teaching history.

You can contact me at ``baytekin (circled 'a') umd (point) edu``.
